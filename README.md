Hello! This page serves to show off some of the personal projects I've completed during my time as a student at the University at Buffalo. Thanks for dropping by!

## Gaming Arena Console Enclosure

This is a mock up of a console pod enclosure for my university's gaming arena known as Level Up. This was designed using SolidWorks, and it was designed in response to thermal concerns due to the use of PS5 and Xbox consoles inside of the enclosure. While the exact design was not used, some parts were used in the final design, including the presence of a metal grill and exhaust ports to dissapate heat. I also used MATLAB to fabricate a thermal analysis on the cage itself for practice with MATLAB's modeling tools.

Here is the final design currently in use at the university, where the essence of the cage and parts of the enclosure are present:

## 1 to 1 Lasko Fan Model Replication

With SolidWorks, I decided to model an exact replica of the Lasko Cyclone fan I had sitting in my room as an assembly drawing. Each part of the fan was modeled as a seperate part, as it came in the box when I bought it; the fan blades, the cage, the stand, the base, and the motor were all modeled with 1:1 scale dimensions taken with real life. The parts were then all combined into an assembly drawing, in the order of actual assembly of the product. The model's blades and stand also move just as they do in real life. 

Here's the real life version:
