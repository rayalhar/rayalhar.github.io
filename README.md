GLADOS, or Glint Analyzing Data Observation Satellite, is a nanosatellite being developed by the UBNL (University at Buffalo Nanosatellite Program) under the University Nanosatellite Program. 
I am part of the Operations team, which deals with preparing for the satellite’s daily communication and operation once it is launched.

- **My Goal:** Support a 6U CubeSat mission to characterize GEO objects.  
- **My Work:** Built mission control testbed, wrote exception-handling docs, integrated subsystems.  
- **Result:** Delivered validated ground systems and ops procedures ahead of 2025 launch.  
_Tools: MATLAB, Simulink, Python, SDR radios_
