# Ray's Project Portfolio (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Hello! This page serves to show off some of the personal projects I've completed during my time as a student at the University at Buffalo. Thanks for dropping by!

## Gaming Arena Console Enclosure

This is a mock up of a console pod enclosure for my university's gaming arena known as Level Up. This was designed using SolidWorks, and it was designed in response to thermal concerns due to the use of PS5 and Xbox consoles inside of the enclosure. While the exact design was not used, some parts were used in the final design, including the presence of a metal grill and exhaust ports to dissapate heat. I also used MATLAB to fabricate a thermal analysis on the cage itself for practice with MATLAB's modeling tools.

Here is the final design currently in use at the university, where the essence of the cage and parts of the enclosure are present:

## 1 to 1 Lasko Fan Model Replication

With SolidWorks, I decided to model a replica of the Lasko Cyclone fan I had sitting in my room as an assembly drawing. Each part of the fan was modeled as a seperate part, as it came in the box when I bought it; the fan blades, the cage, the stand, the base, and the motor were all modeled with 1:1 scale dimensions taken with real life. The parts were then all combined into an assembly drawing, in the order of actual assembly of the product. The model's blades and stand also move just as they do in real life. 

Here's the real life version:

The model I created was missing a few details such as the embossing on the stand, some flares on the shaft as well as the rim of the fan cage. Overall, it was really great practice modeling unusual and unsymmetric shapes in the software.

## Steam Turbine Ideal Rankine Cycle Simulator

Using MATLAB, I developed a small program to simulate the ideal rankine cycle in a steam turbine, a concept reviewed in a Thermodynamics course I took previously as an assistant to help me with a course final project. This program took input for multiple variables such as inlet pressure, temperature, pump speed, efficiency, flow rate. The resulting output gave quantites such as the quality of the steam, the overall thermal efficiency, and even power generated during the cycle. This allows one to see the impact of changing variables such as pressure and temperature in a quick and efficient manner.

For steam table calculations, I used a MATLAB function created by UB SEAS faculty given to students, which automatically calculating all enthalpys and entropies needed. 

Here's a quick demo of the simulator:

For this demo, I purposely used values that would return extreme properties to show the flexibility of the program using essentially any value. While the outputs may not be realistic, it makes the impact of changing things such as temperature and pressure on the cycle much easier to see.
